A Swift Package Manager wrapper that allows the creation of macOS apps with Swift packages instead of Xcode projects. My end goal is to be able to create apps for Windows, Linux and macOS with a single Swift codebase. You may also be interested in [SwiftCrossUI](https://github.com/stackotter/swift-cross-ui), a UI framework with a similar goal.

## Supporting Swift Bundler ‚ù§Ô∏è

If you find Swift Bundler useful, please consider supporting me by [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/stackotter). I spend most of my spare time working on open-source projects, and every single sponsorship helps me focus more time on making high quality tools for the community.

## Installation üì¶

```sh
sh <(curl -L https://stackotter.dev/swift-bundler/install.sh)
```

## Getting started üö¶

Use the following command to create a new app from the SwiftUI template.

```sh
# Create a new app from the SwiftUI template
swift bundler create HelloWorld --template SwiftUI
cd HelloWorld
```

### Running the app

Use the `run` command to build and run the app.

```sh
swift bundler run
```

### Using Xcode as your IDE

Run the `generate-xcode-support` command if you want to use Xcode as your IDE. This command only needs to be run once unless you delete the `.swiftpm` directory.

```sh
# Creates the files necessary to get xcode to run the package as an app
swift bundler generate-xcode-support
```

To open the package in Xcode, just run `open Package.swift`, or use Finder to open `Package.swift` with Xcode. To run the app, just select the scheme with the same name as your app and then click run.

## Documentation üìö
